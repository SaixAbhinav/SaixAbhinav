# Hi there, I'm Sai Abhinav! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **BCA student at VIPS Learning** with a passion for **machine learning** and artificial intelligence. I love diving into data, exploring new algorithms, and building projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with tech.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

- Experimenting with various machine learning models and frameworks.
- Exploring deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Collaborating on projects that integrate data science with creative solutions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Machine Learning & AI:** TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Keras, PyTorch
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Tools & Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

## ðŸ“š Projects

- **Project 1:** [Fake Account Detector](https://github.com/SaixAbhinav/Instagram_fake_account_detector)  
  Leverages machine learning to identify fake Instagram accounts by analyzing profile data, and engagement patterns.
  This project helps detect suspicious activities and potential bot behaviors, making social media platforms safer and more reliable.
- **Project 2:** [Skin Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/SaixAbhinav/skin_cancer_prediction)  
  Utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze dermatological images and predict the likelihood of skin cancer. By processing and classifying visual features, this project aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes through timely detection.
- **Project 3:** [Crazy Traffic](https://github.com/SaixAbhinav/Crazy_Traffic)  
  A dynamic endless runner game developed in Unity, where players navigate through an ever-changing obstacle course filled with car cones and other hazards. This project focuses on smooth gameplay, vibrant visuals, and engaging challenges to provide endless  
  entertainment.
